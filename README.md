<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

<p align="center">Hi there! I'm Piotr, a passionate Python developer with a love for clean code, problem-solving, and building impactful projects.</p>

<p align="center">I have 1 year of experience in software development, specializing in Python programming. My journey in coding started with a fascination for technology and a desire to create software that makes a difference.</p>

<p align="center">I'm currently pursuing Software engineering boo tamp, where I'm diving deeper into Python programming. I'm excited about the possibilities that offers and am always eager to expand my skill set.</p>

<p align="center">When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or diving into a good book. I'm also a big fan of coffee and enjoy discovering new coffee shops around town.</p>

<p align="center">Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you'd like to chat about Python, software development, or anything else tech-related. Let's connect and build something awesome together!</p>


Thank You for Visiting!</h2>
